# Todo-app
  I have developed a to-do app using React, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The app features a user-friendly interface where users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks. The React framework allows for dynamic updates, ensuring that any changes to the task list are instantly reflected without requiring a page refresh.   The app is likely structured with components to handle different aspects of the task management process, such as input fields for adding new tasks, lists for displaying tasks, and buttons for editing or deleting tasks. React's state management ensures smooth user interactions, while the overall design is clean and responsive, making the app accessible across various devices. This to-do app serves as a practical tool for staying organized and managing daily tasks effectively.
